The **Hotspot Manager** is  web interface used to configure and manage the Hotspot.

## Roles

There are 3 different profiles that can access the Hotspot Manager, each profile has different authorizations
and can access only sections related to its own role.

The 3 profiles are the following:

1. Reseller: can see everything related to its own Hotspots
2. Customer: can see everything related to one Hotspot
3. Desk: can only see users related to one Hotspot

There is also a special `admin` user who has the ability to create/modify/delete resellers and edit manage all Hotspots.

### Reseller

The vendor which installs the physical firewall and creates an Hotspot entity; he can create users for his own Hotspot instances.
This is the only profile that can access creation API.
The Reseller can see everything on the Hotspot Manager, he makes the first configuration of the Hotspot, choosing the best options for the specific customer.

**Every technical or potentially dangerous configuration must be performed only by the reseller.**

The reseller can access the Hotppot Manager and create login credentials for other profiles.
Every Hotspot can have only 2 different profiles/accounts.

The reseller accounts can be created only from admin user.

### Customer

* customize the captive portal

## Single sign-on

(**Not yet implemented**)

To integrate resellers authentication, sharing the same credentials from another platform that already has the profiles credentials, Icaro must integrate an API to include resellers without adding one by one using a brand new API, using a master key auth mode.

Scenario

A company has an internal platform that already has customers or resellers and they login with their credentials in that portal. The company wants to enable the login of that resellers also in their Icaro instance and to make this possibile Icaro must include an API to integrate the resellers easily and programmatically.

## The Dashboard

(**Partially implemented**)

The dashboard shows informations about the use of the service.
It has 3 levels of informations depending on the user authorizations.

1. General data about the use of the service (login and SMS users only)
2. Social network data (when we have login via social network)
3. Data obtained through a questionnaire (mainly hotel use)

## Sessions
